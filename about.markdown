---

I'm St√©phane R. Richard (R. for Robert, my middle name. I know, not very sexy, but I can live with that, and that's also a damned good identifier on the web...).
I'm a french CG artist, musician and software developer. That's a few different things, and here is the place where I try to present them all.

  I'll soon post here some CG artworks in a portfolio page.
  You can listen to some of my music here.
  You can visit my github profile and have a look to some of my open source contributions.

Feel free to contact me at: blog@zanshine.com
